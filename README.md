üî• Project Megumin
Project Megumin focuses on the vector thrust control (TVC) of a solid-fuel rocket engine using:

Arduino Nano microcontroller

Dual-axis servo system

MPU6050 IMU for stabilization feedback

Full stabilization solely by TVC with no aerodynamic surfaces

Source file:
rocket_stabilization_test_code.ino

üéÆ Transmitter Controller
The Transmitter Controller is a custom-built wireless controller:

RF24 radio communication to Kagura and YATO-Umbrella

Joystick and button interface

Integrated OLED display for status visuals

Source file:
transmitter_for_mobilized_platform_and_turret_test_code.ino

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Clone the repository.

Open the .ino files in Arduino IDE.

Connect your Arduino board.
